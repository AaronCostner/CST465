<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
I was born down near Fresno, California, but I have lived the majority of my life in Sutherlin and Roseburg. I came out of Roseburg High School in a graduating class of about 384 as one of the 40ish 4.0 students. I came to Oregon Tech because I wanted to be close to home, and the campus was small enough that classes sizes would be small enough to have an interaction with my professors.  I considered OSU as well, but that place was like a labyrinth to me, and it also did not feel like a place where I would learn computer programming by actually programming unlike Oregon Tech.
</p>

<p>
I have 1 brother whose name is Tyler Costner. He is currently going to Roseburg High School, and whenever I go back home, I always feel like more people know who my brother is and enjoy his presence. In turn, his popularity also means that people sort of know who I am because we look very alike. Of course, that contributes to a problem I have where people sometimes do not remember my name. I have been called Tyler, Tyler's Dad, Kevin, Bill, Eric, and Ian as far as I can remember. But I digress.  I love my brother, and I always look forward to seeing him when I come home.
